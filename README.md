> **Stand-In** is a lightweight, plug-and-play framework for identity-preserving video generation. By training only **1%** additional parameters compared to the base video generation model, we achieve state-of-the-art results in both Face Similarity and Naturalness, outperforming various full-parameter training methods. Moreover, **Stand-In** can be seamlessly integrated into other tasks such as subject-driven video generation, pose-controlled video generation, video stylization, and face swapping.

## 🔥 News
* **[2025.08.16]** We have updated the experimental version of the face swapping feature. Feel free to try it out!

* **[2025.08.13]** Special thanks to @kijai for integrating Stand-In into the custom ComfyUI node **WanVideoWrapper**. However, the implementation differs from the official version, which may affect Stand-In’s performance.  
   In order to address part of the issue, we have urgently released the official Stand-In preprocessing ComfyUI node:  
  👉 https://github.com/WeChatCV/Stand-In_Preprocessor_ComfyUI  
  If you wish to experience Stand-In within ComfyUI, please use **our official preprocessing node** to replace the one implemented by kijai.  
  For the best results, we recommend waiting for the release of our full **official Stand-In ComfyUI**.

* **[2025.08.12]** Released Stand-In v1.0 (153M parameters), the Wan2.1-14B-T2V–adapted weights and inference code are now open-sourced.

## 📖 Key Features
- Efficient Training: Only 1% of the base model parameters need to be trained.
- High Fidelity: Outstanding identity consistency without sacrificing video generation quality.
- Plug-and-Play: Easily integrates into existing T2V (Text-to-Video) models.
- Highly Extensible: Compatible with community models such as LoRA, and supports various downstream video tasks.

---

## ✅ Todo List 
- [x] Release IP2V inference script (compatible with community LoRA).
- [x] Open-source model weights compatible with Wan2.1-14B-T2V: `Stand-In_Wan2.1-T2V-14B_153M_v1.0`。
- [ ] Open-source model weights compatible with Wan2.2-T2V-A14B.
- [ ] Release training dataset, data preprocessing scripts, and training code.

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Environment Setup
```bash
# Clone the project repository
git clone https://github.com/WeChatCV/Stand-In.git
cd Stand-In

# Create and activate Conda environment
conda create -n Stand-In python=3.11 -y
conda activate Stand-In

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# (Optional) Install Flash Attention for faster inference
# Note: Make sure your GPU and CUDA version are compatible with Flash Attention
pip install flash-attn --no-build-isolation
```

### 2. Model Download
We provide an automatic download script that will fetch all required model weights into the  `checkpoints` directory.
```bash
python download_models.py
```
This script will download the following models:
* `wan2.1-T2V-14B` (base text-to-video model)
* `antelopev2` (face recognition model)
* `Stand-In` (our Stand-In model)

> Note: If you already have the `wan2.1-T2V-14B model` locally, you can manually edit the `download_model.py` script to comment out the relevant download code and place the model in the `checkpoints/wan2.1-T2V-14B` directory.

## 🧪 Usage

### Standard Inference

Use the `infer.py` script for standard identity-preserving text-to-video generation.


```bash
python infer.py \
    --prompt "A man sits comfortably at a desk, facing the camera as if talking to a friend or family member on the screen. His gaze is focused and gentle, with a natural smile. The background is his carefully decorated personal space, with photos and a world map on the wall, conveying a sense of intimate and modern communication." \
    --ip_image "test/input/lecun.jpg" \
    --output "test/output/lecun.mp4"
```
**Prompt Writing Tip:** If you do not wish to alter the subject's facial features, simply use *"a man"* or *"a woman"* without adding extra descriptions of their appearance. Prompts support both Chinese and English input. The prompt is intended for generating frontal, medium-to-close-up videos.

**Input Image Recommendation:** For best results, use a high-resolution frontal face image. There are no restrictions on resolution or file extension, as our built-in preprocessing pipeline will handle them automatically.

---

### Inference with Community LoRA

Use the `infer_with_lora.py` script to load one or more community LoRA models alongside Stand-In.

```bash
python infer_with_lora.py \
    --prompt "A man sits comfortably at a desk, facing the camera as if talking to a friend or family member on the screen. His gaze is focused and gentle, with a natural smile. The background is his carefully decorated personal space, with photos and a world map on the wall, conveying a sense of intimate and modern communication." \
    --ip_image "test/input/lecun.jpg" \
    --output "test/output/lecun.mp4" \
    --lora_path "path/to/your/lora.safetensors" \
    --lora_scale 1.0
```

We recommend using this stylization LoRA: [https://civitai.com/models/1404755/studio-ghibli-wan21-t2v-14b](https://civitai.com/models/1404755/studio-ghibli-wan21-t2v-14b)

---

### Video Face Swapping

Use the `infer_face_swap.py` script to perform video face swapping with Stand-In.

```bash
python infer_face_swap.py \
    --prompt "The video features a woman standing in front of a large screen displaying the words ""Tech Minute"" and the logo for CNET. She is wearing a purple top and appears to be presenting or speaking about technology-related topics. The background includes a cityscape with tall buildings, suggesting an urban setting. The woman seems to be engaged in a discussion or providing information on technology news or trends. The overall atmosphere is professional and informative, likely aimed at educating viewers about the latest developments in the tech industry." \
    --ip_image "test/input/ruonan.jpg" \
    --output "test/output/ruonan.mp4" \
    --denoising_strength 0.85
```

**Note**: Since Wan2.1 itself does not have an inpainting function, our face swapping feature is still experimental.

The higher the denoising_strength, the more the background area is redrawn, and the more natural the face area becomes. Conversely, the lower the denoising_strength, the less the background area is redrawn, and the higher the degree of overfitting in the face area.

You can set --force_background_consistency to make the background completely consistent, but this may lead to potential and noticeable contour issues. Enabling this feature requires experimenting with different denoising_strength values to achieve the most natural effect. If slight changes to the background are not a concern, please do not enable this feature.
